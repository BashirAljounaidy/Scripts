# My Bash Scripts

Welcome to my collection of handy bash scripts that have made my life as a developer easier. These scripts are designed to streamline various tasks, automate repetitive actions, and improve productivity. To make the most of these scripts, consider adding their path to your environment variables and installing them in your home folder.

## Getting Started

To start using these scripts, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Add the repository's path to your environment variables to easily access the scripts from any location in your terminal.

```bash

export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/your/repo"
```

3. For added convenience, consider installing these scripts in your home folder to access them globally.

```bash
./install.sh
```

## List of Scripts

## How to Use
